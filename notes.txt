Explanation of each column header in the Dataset
-------------------------------------------------


e_magic: Occupies 2 bytes and represents a fixed value and serves

e_cblp: The number of bytes on the last page of the file


e_cp: The number of pages in the file


e_crlc: Relocations


e_cparhdr: Size of header in 16 byte segments (a.k.a paragraphs)


e_minalloc: Minimum extra paragraphs needed


e_maxalloc: Maximum extra paragraphs needed

e_ss: Initial (relative) SS value. In other words, initial value 
      of the stack segement register. Used for temporary storage of 
      data for the program.


e_sp:  the initial value of the stack pointer register (SP) when 
       the program is loaded and executed.



e_csum: Checksum, plays a role in the integrity of the file


e_ip: Initial value of the instruction pointer register


e_cs: Initial value of the code segment register


e_lfarlc: File address of the relocation table


e_ovno: Overlay number (identifies which overlay is currently loaded)


e_oemid: 2 byte identifier that the manafacturer assigns



e_oeminfo: More info about the OEM that created the file 



e_lfanew: File address of new exe header, tells the system where to look 
          for the file header.



Machine: The number that identifies the type of target machine

NumberOfSections: The number of sections. Indicates the size of the section
                  table.


TimeDateStamp: The low 32 bits of the number of seconds since 
                00:00 January 1, 1970 (a C run-time time_t value), 
                which indicates when the file was created.


PointerToSymbolTable: Not really important

NumberOfSymbols: Not really important

SizeOfOptionalHeader: Not really important


Characteristics: Attributes of the file


Magic: The unsigned integer that identifies the state of the image file.

MajorLinkerVersion: The linker major version number.


MinorLinkerVersion: The linker minor version number


SizeOfCode: The size of the code (text) section, or the sum of all code sections
            if there are multiple sections.


SizeOfInitializedData: The size of the initialized data section, or the sum of all such 
                       sections if there are multiple data sections.
